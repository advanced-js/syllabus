# Mashup

This project is open-ended!  Build a site that uses data from at least one external API in an interesting way.  In other words, the JS code should be **non-trivial**.  That being said... start simple!  No server-side coding is required, but feel free to create a backend in whatever language if you like, if you need one.

Bonus points:

* automated tests
    * [Sinon.js fakeServer](http://sinonjs.org/docs/#fakeServer) may be helpful
* fancy interactivity/animations
